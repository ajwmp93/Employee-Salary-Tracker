# Employee Salary Tracker

## Description

I wanted to create functions in this project that would allow an Employer to enter in their employee's first name, last name, and salary and see it on a centralized table on the web page, as well as have access to the table and to the average salary of all employees in the console. This will allow Employers to easily add all of their employees and have them listed in a centralized location as well as quickly find out the average salary for all employees to assist in budgeting. This project helped to add to my knowledge of JavaScript functions as well as introduce many new functions we had not learned yet. I hope to continue to learn about the ins and outs of JavaScript and how helpful it can be for companies and web developers alike. 

## Usage

When the web page loads, click on the add employee button. Add as many employees as needed and when you are done, click the cancel button that will come up with the prompt "Do you want to add more employees?". When you click cancel, a table should load within the web page that includes the employee's first name, last name, and salary. Once this has loaded you can enter the web pages devTools by right clicking the page, clicking inspect, and clicking the console tab in the devTools sidebar. This will bring up the table again, as well as the average salary of all employees.
